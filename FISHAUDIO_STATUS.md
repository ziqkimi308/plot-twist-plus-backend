## 🔄 **Current Fallback System Still Works**

Even without Fish Audio credits, your system still works:

```
Script Input
    ↓
1️⃣  ElevenLabs (if API key exists)
    ↓ (if fails)
2️⃣  Fish Audio (if API key + credits exist)  ← Currently: No credits
    ↓ (if fails)
3️⃣  Google TTS (always available)  ← Will use this
    ↓
Audio Generated ✅
```

---

## ✅ **What Works Now**

Your system will automatically use:
- **ElevenLabs** for high quality (10k chars/month)
- **Google TTS** as fallback (unlimited)

Fish Audio will kick in once you have credits!
