# Audio Playback Fix - Complete ✅

## Problem

Audio playback buttons were playing mock TTS audio instead of the actual generated audio files.

## Root Causes

### 1. Act Format Mismatch

- **Backend** generates audio with acts as words: `"ONE"`, `"TWO"`, `"THREE"`
- **Frontend** ProductPlayer was filtering by Roman numerals: `"I"`, `"II"`, `"III"`
- Result: `getActAudioFiles()` returned empty arrays, triggering fallback to mock TTS

### 2. Folder Mapping Incomplete

- ProductPlayer's `actFolderMap` only mapped Roman numerals
- Word-based acts (`"ONE"`, `"TWO"`, `"THREE"`) had no mapping
- Result: Even if files were found, wrong folder paths would be constructed

### 3. Audio Endpoint Path Mismatch

- **Backend** endpoint: `/api/generate-voice/audio/:filename`
- **Frontend** requesting: `/api/generate-voice/audio/:actFolder/:filename`
- Result: 404 errors when trying to fetch audio files

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated ProductPlayer Act Filtering (ProductPlayer.jsx)

```jsx
// Before
function getActAudioFiles(actIndex) {
	const actNumbers = ["I", "II", "III"];
	const actLabel = actNumbers[actIndex];
	return (productData?.audioFiles || []).filter((f) => f.act === actLabel);
}

// After
function getActAudioFiles(actIndex) {
	const actNumbersRoman = ["I", "II", "III"];
	const actNumbersWords = ["ONE", "TWO", "THREE"];
	const actLabelRoman = actNumbersRoman[actIndex];
	const actLabelWord = actNumbersWords[actIndex];

	return (productData?.audioFiles || []).filter(
		(f) => f.act === actLabelRoman || f.act === actLabelWord
	);
}
```

### 2. Updated Folder Mapping (ProductPlayer.jsx)

```jsx
// Before
const actFolderMap = {
	I: "voice-act-one",
	II: "voice-act-two",
	III: "voice-act-three",
};

// After
const actFolderMap = {
	I: "voice-act-one",
	II: "voice-act-two",
	III: "voice-act-three",
	ONE: "voice-act-one",
	TWO: "voice-act-two",
	THREE: "voice-act-three",
};
```

### 3. Updated Audio Serving Endpoint (generateVoice.js)

```javascript
// Before
router.get('/audio/:filename', (req, res) => { ... });

// After
router.get('/audio/:actFolder/:filename', (req, res) => {
    const { actFolder, filename } = req.params;

    // Validate act folder
    const validActFolders = ['voice-act-one', 'voice-act-two', 'voice-act-three'];
    if (!validActFolders.includes(actFolder)) {
        return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid act folder' });
    }

    // Serve from: data/voice/voice-act-{one|two|three}/filename.mp3
    const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'data', 'voice', actFolder, filename);
    res.sendFile(filePath);
});
```

## Results

### Before Fix:

- All play buttons triggered mock TTS audio
- Console showed: `"Playing audio (TTS): This is Act One of your story..."`
- No actual MP3 files were being accessed

### After Fix:

- Play buttons load actual generated audio files
- Console shows: `"Playing audio: http://localhost:3000/api/generate-voice/audio/voice-act-one/000_NARRATOR.mp3"`
- All 42 audio files (16 + 15 + 11) are accessible and playable

## File Distribution

```
data/voice/
├── voice-act-one/     (16 files: 000-015)
├── voice-act-two/     (15 files: 016-030)
└── voice-act-three/   (11 files: 031-041)
```

## Testing

1. ✅ Audio endpoint responds with 200 OK
2. ✅ Content-Type: audio/mpeg
3. ✅ Files accessible via browser: `http://localhost:3000/api/generate-voice/audio/voice-act-one/000_NARRATOR.mp3`
4. ✅ ProductPlayer filters audio files correctly by act
5. ✅ Folder mapping resolves correct paths

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/components/ProductPlayer.jsx`
  - Updated `getActAudioFiles()` to support both Roman numerals and words
  - Updated `actFolderMap` to include word-based acts
- `backend/routes/generateVoice.js`
  - Changed endpoint from `/audio/:filename` to `/audio/:actFolder/:filename`
  - Added act folder validation
  - Updated file path construction

## Next Steps

- Test full playback sequence (Act 1 → Act 2 → Act 3)
- Verify audio queue handling
- Test error states (missing files, network errors)
- Add loading indicators for audio buffering
