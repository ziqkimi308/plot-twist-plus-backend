# Card-Based Act Layout with Modal Viewer - Complete ✅

## Feature Overview

Transformed the act display from a simple grid to an interactive card-based layout with an immersive modal overlay for viewing each act's image, script, and audio controls.

## New Features

### 1. **Card-Based Act Display**

- Three beautiful cards representing each act
- Hover effects with image zoom and overlay
- Descriptive titles and descriptions:
  - Act 1: "The Beginning" - The story begins with our hero's ordinary world
  - Act 2: "The Conflict" - Rising tension and dramatic revelations
  - Act 3: "The Resolution" - The climactic conclusion and resolution

### 2. **Interactive Modal Overlay**

When clicking on any act card, a full-screen modal opens with:

#### Left Side: Image Display

- Full-size act image
- Dark background for better focus
- Caption overlay with act name and title
- Image fills available space with object-fit: contain

#### Right Side: Script & Controls

- **Header Section**:

  - Script title
  - Play/Stop audio button with gradient styling
  - Loading state with spinner animation

- **Script Content**:
  - Auto-scrolling script text (no sync required)
  - Monospace font for screenplay format
  - Smooth scroll animation from bottom to top
  - Custom purple scrollbar
  - Reads from actual script data and extracts act-specific content

### 3. **Auto-Scrolling Script**

- Automatically scrolls from bottom to top when modal opens
- Smooth easing animation
- Duration calculated based on content length (min 30s, ~50ms per pixel)
- Continues until reaching the top
- Stops automatically when modal closes

### 4. **Enhanced Audio Controls**

- Integrated play button in modal header
- Visual states:
  - Default: Purple gradient play button
  - Playing: Red gradient stop button
  - Loading: Spinner with "Loading..." text
- Stops audio automatically when modal closes
- Same audio system from previous fix (42 files across 3 acts)

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified

**`frontend/src/components/ProductPlayer.jsx`**

- Added state: `selectedAct` (tracks which modal is open)
- Added ref: `scriptScrollRef` (for auto-scroll animation)
- New functions:
  - `handleCardClick(actIndex)` - Opens modal
  - `handleCloseModal()` - Closes modal and stops audio
  - `getActScript(actIndex)` - Extracts act-specific script content
- New useEffect hook for auto-scroll animation using requestAnimationFrame

### Styling Added

- `.act-card-content` - Card text content

**Modal Styles:**

## User Experience Flow

1. **Landing**: User sees three beautiful act cards in a grid
2. **Hover**: Image zooms, overlay appears with "Click to view"
3. **Click**: Modal slides up with fade-in animation
4. **View**:
   - Left: Full act image
   - Right: Script starts auto-scrolling from bottom
5. **Listen**: Click play button to hear act audio
6. **Exit**: Click X or backdrop to close (audio stops automatically)

## Script Extraction Logic

```javascript
getActScript(actIndex) {
  // Finds **ACT ONE**, **ACT TWO**, **ACT THREE** markers
  // Extracts content between current and next act marker
  // Returns act-specific script content
}
```

## Auto-Scroll Algorithm

```javascript
- Calculate total scroll distance
- Duration = max(30s, distance * 50ms)
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animation
- Easing function: progress * (2 - progress) for smooth deceleration
- Cleanup on modal close
```

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme

- **Primary**: Purple gradient (#9333ea → #ec4899)
- **Secondary**: Orange accent (#fb923c)
- **Background**: White cards on light gray
- **Modal**: Dark backdrop (rgba(0,0,0,0.85))
- **Text**: Dark gray (#1f2937) on white

### Typography

- **Descriptions**: Regular, 0.95rem
