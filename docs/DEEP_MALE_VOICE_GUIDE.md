## How to Change Narrator Voice

### Option 1: Edit ttsEngine.js (Permanent Change)

File: `backend/utils/ttsEngine.js`

```javascript
// Find this line (around line 517):
const gcpNarrator = "en-US-Wavenet-D"; // Current

// Change to another voice:
const gcpNarrator = "en-US-Neural2-D"; // Alternative

// And adjust settings:
const gcpNarratorSettings = {
	speakingRate: 0.85, // 0.82-0.92 (slower = more authoritative)
	pitch: -8.0, // -10 to -5 (lower = deeper)
};
```

### Option 2: Override in API Request (Temporary)

```javascript
await fetch("/api/generate-voice", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
	body: JSON.stringify({
		includeNarration: true,
		provider: "google-cloud-tts",
		voiceMapping: {
			NARRATOR: "en-US-Wavenet-D", // Override voice
		},
	}),
});
```

**Note**: When using option 2, the pitch/rate settings from `gcpNarratorSettings` will still apply!

## Pitch & Rate Guide

### Pitch Values (-20 to +20)

- `-20` to `-15`: Extremely deep (may sound unnatural)
- **`-10` to `-8`**: Very deep (great for narrator) ‚Üê **RECOMMENDED**
- `-7` to `-5`: Deep
- `-4` to `-2`: Slightly deeper
- `0`: Normal
- `+2` to `+5`: Higher/younger

### Speaking Rate Values (0.25 to 4.0)

- `0.70` to `0.80`: Very slow (dramatic)
- **`0.82` to `0.88`**: Slow, authoritative ‚Üê **RECOMMENDED FOR NARRATOR**
- `0.90` to `0.95`: Slightly slow
- `1.0`: Normal
- `1.05` to `1.15`: Faster (energetic)

---

## Testing Different Voices

1. **Quick test** (restart server after editing):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Edit ttsEngine.js, change gcpNarrator value
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Regenerate voice** from frontend:

   - Generate new story with narration enabled
   - Listen to `000_NARRATOR.mp3` in `data/voice/voice-act-one/`

3. **Compare**: Keep old files before regenerating to compare voices

---

## Current Configuration

**File**: `backend/utils/ttsEngine.js` (line ~517)

```javascript
const gcpNarrator = "en-US-Wavenet-D"; // VERY DEEP male narrator
const gcpNarratorSettings = {
	speakingRate: 0.82, // Very slow, authoritative
	pitch: -10.0, // Very deep tone
};
```

**Effect**: Produces the DEEPEST male narrator voice available in Google Cloud TTS.

## Troubleshooting

### "Voice still sounds female"

- Check: Make sure backend server restarted after editing
- Check: Confirm provider is "google-cloud-tts" (not "elevenlabs" or "google")
- Check: Verify GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is set
- Solution: Regenerate voice (delete old files first)

### "Voice is too deep/unnatural"

- Reduce pitch: Try -8.0 or -6.0 instead of -10.0
- Try different voice: en-US-Neural2-D is more natural
- Increase rate: Try 0.85 or 0.88 instead of 0.82

### "Voice is not deep enough"

- Increase pitch depth: Try -12.0 (but may sound robotic)
- Try en-US-Wavenet-D (deepest option)
- Reduce speaking rate: Try 0.80
