# Diverse International Accents Implemented ✅

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETE

## Problem

Male character voices sounded too similar to the narrator, lacking variety and distinctiveness. All voices were American English with only pitch variations.

## Solution

Implemented a diverse voice pool featuring accents from different regions around the world.

## New Voice Pools

### Male Voices (7 diverse accents)

```javascript
const gcpMale = [
	"en-IN-Neural2-B", // Indian accent (Asia)
	"en-GB-Neural2-D", // British accent (Europe)
	"en-AU-Neural2-D", // Australian accent
	"en-US-Neural2-A", // American accent (different from narrator)
	"en-GB-Wavenet-B", // British Wavenet (more natural)
	"en-IN-Wavenet-B", // Indian Wavenet
	"en-AU-Wavenet-D", // Australian Wavenet
];
```

### Female Voices (6 diverse accents)

```javascript
const gcpFemale = [
	"en-US-Neural2-F", // American female
	"en-GB-Neural2-A", // British female
	"en-AU-Neural2-A", // Australian female
	"en-IN-Neural2-A", // Indian female
	"en-GB-Wavenet-A", // British Wavenet female
	"en-AU-Wavenet-A", // Australian Wavenet female
];
```

### Narrator (unchanged)

```javascript
const gcpNarrator = "en-US-Wavenet-D"; // Very deep American male
```

## Voice Settings

- **Narrator:** Pitch -10.0, Rate 0.82 (very deep)
- **Male Characters:** Pitch -5.0, Rate 0.95 (natural lower pitch)
- **Female Characters:** Pitch -3.0, Rate 0.98 (natural, not high-pitched)

## Accent Detection

The system now logs which accent each character is using:

```
🎙️  [2] Male (Indian) - Voice: en-IN-Neural2-B, Pitch: -5.0, Rate: 0.95
🎙️  [3] Female (British) - Voice: en-GB-Neural2-A, Pitch: -3.0, Rate: 0.98
🎙️  [4] Male (Australian) - Voice: en-AU-Neural2-D, Pitch: -5.0, Rate: 0.95
```

## Voice Detection Logic

Updated to properly detect gender across all accent variants:

- **Female:** Voices ending in `-A`, `-C`, `-F` or containing "Female"
- **Male:** Voices ending in `-B`, `-D`, `-G` or containing "Male"

## Regional Coverage

- 🇺🇸 **American:** en-US voices
- 🇬🇧 **British:** en-GB voices
- 🇦🇺 **Australian:** en-AU voices
- 🇮🇳 **Indian:** en-IN voices

## Benefits

1. **Character Distinctiveness:** Each male character now has a unique accent
2. **Global Representation:** Voices from Asia, Europe, and Oceania
3. **Natural Sound:** Using both Neural2 and Wavenet models for variety
4. **Consistent Quality:** All voices maintain natural pitch and speaking rate
5. **Narrator Contrast:** Deep American narrator stands out from diverse character voices

## Testing

Generate a story with multiple male and female characters to hear:

- Different accents for each character
- Narrator remains deep American male
- Natural pitch levels (no high-pitched voices)
- Proper accent logging in console

## Technical Implementation

File: `backend/utils/ttsEngine.js`

- Lines 515-531: Voice pool definitions
- Lines 675-695: Accent detection and logging
- Lines 687-691: Gender detection regex pattern

## User Feedback

✅ Narrator voice loved (deep male)  
✅ Female voices sound natural (Sarah)  
⚠️ Male voices were too similar → FIXED with diverse accents
