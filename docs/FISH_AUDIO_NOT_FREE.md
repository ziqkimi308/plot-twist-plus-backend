# ❌ Fish Audio - Not Free for API Use

## 🔍 **Discovery**

Fish Audio was tested as a secondary TTS provider, but discovered that:

**API Access Requires Premium Subscription** ($11+/month minimum)

---

## 📝 **From Fish Audio Documentation:**

> "Do you offer API access?  
> Yes! **Premium subscribers** get access to our flexible pay-as-you-go API."

---

## 💰 **Pricing:**

- **Free Tier:** Website/playground only (no API access)
- **Plus Plan:** $11/month (API access included)
- **Pro Plan:** $75/month (API access included)

---

## ✅ **What We're Using Instead:**

### **Current TTS System (FREE):**

```
1️⃣  ElevenLabs (Primary)
    • 10,000 chars/month FREE
    • 12 custom voices
    • API included in free tier
    • ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Best quality
    ↓ (if fails)
    
2️⃣  Google TTS (Secondary)
    • Unlimited FREE forever
    • Always available
    • No API key needed
    • ⭐⭐⭐ Basic quality
```

## 📊 **Comparison:**

| Provider | Free API? | Quality | Cost |
|----------|-----------|---------|------|
| **ElevenLabs** | ✅ Yes (10k chars/mo) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | FREE |
| **Fish Audio** | ❌ No (requires $11+/mo) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | PAID |
| **Google TTS** | ✅ Yes (unlimited) | ⭐⭐⭐ | FREE |

---

## ✅ **Current System Status:**

✅ **ElevenLabs** - FREE API, high quality, custom voices  
❌ **Fish Audio** - Removed (requires payment)  
✅ **Google TTS** - FREE unlimited, always available  

**Your system has everything you need for free!** 🎙️

---

## 🎯 **Summary:**

- Fish Audio API integration was **removed**
- Only truly FREE providers remain
- **2-tier fallback:** ElevenLabs → Google TTS
- Both work perfectly without any paid subscriptions

**No need for Fish Audio - your current setup is better!** ✅
