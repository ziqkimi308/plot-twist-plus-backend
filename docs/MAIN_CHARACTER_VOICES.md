# Main Character Voice System Implemented ✅

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETE

## Overview

Implemented a tiered voice system where main characters get consistent, high-quality dedicated voices while supporting characters have diverse international accents.

## Voice Hierarchy

### 🎭 Tier 1: Narrator

```javascript
Voice: 'en-US-Wavenet-D'
Settings: { pitch: -10.0, speakingRate: 0.82 }
Character: VERY DEEP American male narrator
```

### 👑 Tier 2: Main Characters (First Male & First Female)

#### Main Male Character

```javascript
Voice: 'en-GB-Wavenet-D'
Settings: { pitch: -6.0, speakingRate: 0.92 }
Accent: British (England)
Character: Deep & fierce, powerful presence
Note: Not as deep as narrator but commanding
```

#### Main Female Character

```javascript
Voice: 'en-US-Neural2-H'
Settings: { pitch: -2.0, speakingRate: 0.95 }
Accent: American (United States)
Character: Clear, strong, confident female lead
```

### 🌍 Tier 3: Supporting Characters (International Cast)

#### Supporting Male Voices

```javascript
[
  'en-IN-Neural2-B',      // Indian accent (Asia)
  'en-AU-Neural2-D',      // Australian accent
  'en-IN-Wavenet-B',      // Indian Wavenet
  'en-AU-Wavenet-D',      // Australian Wavenet
  'en-GB-Neural2-B',      // British (lighter tone)
]
Settings: { pitch: -5.0, speakingRate: 0.95 }
```

#### Supporting Female Voices

```javascript
[
  'en-GB-Neural2-A',      // British female
  'en-AU-Neural2-A',      // Australian female
  'en-IN-Neural2-A',      // Indian female
  'en-AU-Wavenet-A',      // Australian Wavenet
]
Settings: { pitch: -3.0, speakingRate: 0.98 }
```

## Character Assignment Logic

1. **Narrator** - Assigned first if narration is included
2. **First Male Character** → Main Male (British fierce)
3. **First Female Character** → Main Female (American strong)
4. **Subsequent Characters** → Supporting cast (diverse accents rotate)

## Console Output Examples

```
👑 Main Male Character: Marcus -> en-GB-Wavenet-D (British)
👑 Main Female Character: Sarah -> en-US-Neural2-H (American)

🔊 [1] NARRATOR - Voice: en-US-Wavenet-D, Pitch: -10.0, Rate: 0.82
🎙️ [2] 👑 MAIN Male (British) - Voice: en-GB-Wavenet-D, Pitch: -6.0, Rate: 0.92
🎙️ [3] 👑 MAIN Female (American) - Voice: en-US-Neural2-H, Pitch: -2.0, Rate: 0.95
🎙️ [4] Male (Indian) - Voice: en-IN-Neural2-B, Pitch: -5.0, Rate: 0.95
🎙️ [5] Female (Australian) - Voice: en-AU-Neural2-A, Pitch: -3.0, Rate: 0.98
```

## Accent Coverage

### Available Regions

- 🇺🇸 **American:** Main female, narrator
- 🇬🇧 **British:** Main male, supporting cast
- 🇦🇺 **Australian:** Supporting cast only
- 🇮🇳 **Indian:** Supporting cast only

### ❌ Not Available

- 🇷🇺 **Russian English Accent:** Google Cloud TTS does not currently offer Russian-accented English voices. Only native Russian language voices (ru-RU) are available.

**Russian Alternative:** If Russian accent is critical, could use:

1. Native Russian voices for Russian characters (ru-RU-Wavenet-A/B/C/D)
2. ElevenLabs custom voice cloning (premium feature)
3. Wait for Google Cloud TTS to add Russian-accented English voices

## Benefits

1. **Main Character Consistency:**

   - Same voice throughout the story for protagonist
   - Audience easily identifies main characters
   - High-quality Wavenet/Neural2 models

2. **Supporting Character Diversity:**

   - Each minor character has unique accent
   - Prevents voice confusion
   - Represents global cast

3. **Clear Audio Hierarchy:**
   - Narrator: Very deep (pitch -10)
   - Main Male: Deep & fierce (pitch -6)
   - Main Female: Strong & clear (pitch -2)
   - Supporting: Natural variations (pitch -3 to -5)

## Technical Implementation

**File:** `backend/utils/ttsEngine.js`

**Lines 515-539:** Voice pool definitions

```javascript
const gcpMainMale = 'en-GB-Wavenet-D';
const gcpMainFemale = 'en-US-Neural2-H';
const gcpSupportingFemale = [...];
const gcpSupportingMale = [...];
```

**Lines 550-595:** Character assignment with main character detection

```javascript
let mainMaleAssigned = false,
	mainFemaleAssigned = false;
// First male/female get main voices
// Rest get supporting voices
```

**Lines 697-733:** Voice settings application with main character detection

```javascript
const isMainMale = gcVoiceName === gcpMainMale;
const isMainFemale = gcVoiceName === gcpMainFemale;
// Apply appropriate settings
```

## User Requirements Met

✅ **Main male character:** Fixed British voice (deep & fierce, not as deep as narrator)  
✅ **Main female character:** Fixed American voice (strong & clear)  
✅ **Supporting characters:** Diverse accents (Indian, Australian, British variations)  
❌ **Russian accent:** Not available in Google Cloud TTS English voices

## Testing

Generate a story with multiple characters:

1. First male character should be British (fierce)
2. First female character should be American (strong)
3. Additional characters get diverse accents
4. Console shows 👑 crown emoji for main characters
5. All voices sound natural with appropriate pitch
