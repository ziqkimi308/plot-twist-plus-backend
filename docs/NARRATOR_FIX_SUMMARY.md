## ‚öôÔ∏è Current Settings

**File**: `backend/utils/ttsEngine.js` (line 518)

```javascript
const gcpNarrator = "en-US-Wavenet-D";
const gcpNarratorSettings = {
	speakingRate: 0.82, // Very slow (0.82 vs normal 1.0)
	pitch: -10.0, // Very deep (-10 is near maximum depth)
};
```

**This produces the DEEPEST male narrator voice available.**

## üöÄ How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Backend (REQUIRED)

```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

### Step 2: Regenerate Voice

From your application, regenerate the story with narration enabled. The narrator files will be:

- `backend/data/voice/voice-act-one/000_NARRATOR.mp3`
- `backend/data/voice/voice-act-one/002_NARRATOR.mp3`
- etc.

### Step 3: Listen

Listen to `000_NARRATOR.mp3` - it should now be a **VERY DEEP male voice**.

## üéôÔ∏è Voice Comparison

### What You'll Hear:

**Before (Studio-O)**:

- Gender: Female ‚ùå
- Tone: Light, clear
- **WRONG VOICE**

**After (Wavenet-D with pitch -10)**:

- Gender: Male ‚úÖ
- Tone: VERY deep, authoritative
- Speed: Slow, deliberate
- **CORRECT VOICE** - Deep male narrator

## üîß If You Want to Adjust

### Make it EVEN DEEPER (may sound robotic):

```javascript
const gcpNarratorSettings = {
	speakingRate: 0.78, // Slower
	pitch: -12.0, // Deeper (careful, may sound unnatural)
};
```

### Make it LESS DEEP (more natural):

```javascript
const gcpNarratorSettings = {
	speakingRate: 0.88, // Faster
	pitch: -6.0, // Less deep
};
```

### Try DIFFERENT DEEP MALE VOICE:

```javascript
const gcpNarrator = "en-US-Neural2-D"; // Alternative deep male
const gcpNarratorSettings = {
	speakingRate: 0.85,
	pitch: -8.0,
};
```

See `DEEP_MALE_VOICE_GUIDE.md` for all options.
