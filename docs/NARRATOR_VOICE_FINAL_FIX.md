# ✅ NARRATOR VOICE - ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED!

## 🎯 The Problem

The narrator voice was **STILL a woman** even after all the backend changes.

## 🔍 Root Cause

**The frontend was OVERRIDING the backend settings!**

In `frontend/src/components/InputForm.jsx` line 57:

```javascript
❌ WRONG (OLD CODE):
voiceMapping: { NARRATOR: "en-US-Studio-O" }  // This is a FEMALE voice!
```

**"en-US-Studio-O" is a FEMALE voice!** That's why you kept hearing a woman narrator.

## ✅ The Fix

Changed the frontend to use the deep male voice:

```javascript
✅ CORRECT (NEW CODE):
voiceMapping: { NARRATOR: "en-US-Wavenet-D" }  // Deep MALE voice
```

Now the frontend explicitly requests:
- **Voice**: `en-US-Wavenet-D` (VERY DEEP male)
- **Provider**: `google-cloud-tts`
- **Pitch**: -10.0 (applied by backend automatically)
- **Rate**: 0.82 (applied by backend automatically)

## 📝 What Was Changed

### File: `frontend/src/components/InputForm.jsx`

**Line 57 changed from:**
```javascript
voiceMapping: { NARRATOR: "en-US-Studio-O" },  // Female voice ❌
```

**To:**
```javascript
voiceMapping: { NARRATOR: "en-US-Wavenet-D" },  // Deep male voice ✅
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Delete old voice files (already done):
```bash
cd backend
rm -rf data/voice/*
```

### 2. Restart backend:
```bash
cd backend
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="e:/Learning/Web Dev/Web Dev Projects/plot-twist-plus/backend/secret/plot-twist-plus-2797876555d2.json"
node server.js
```

### 3. Restart frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 4. Generate a new story

### 5. Listen to the narrator

The narrator should now be a **VERY DEEP male voice**!

## 📊 What You'll Hear

### Before (Studio-O):
- ❌ Female voice
- ❌ Higher pitch
- ❌ Standard speaking rate

### After (Wavenet-D with pitch -10, rate 0.82):
- ✅ **VERY DEEP male voice**
- ✅ **Lower pitch** (pitch -10.0)
- ✅ **Slower, authoritative** (rate 0.82)

## 🎯 Backend Console Logs

When you generate voice, you should now see:

```
📢 Processing: NARRATOR (Act ONE, Order 0)
   Provider setting: google-cloud-tts
   Character key: NARRATOR
   🎙️  Mapped voice: en-US-Wavenet-D
   🔊 NARRATOR detected - using deep male settings:
      Voice: en-US-Wavenet-D
      Pitch: -10
      Rate: 0.82
   Trying Google Cloud TTS (voice: en-US-Wavenet-D)...
   ✅ Google Cloud TTS success
```

## ✅ Summary

**Problem**: Frontend was hardcoded to use `en-US-Studio-O` (FEMALE voice)

**Solution**: Changed frontend to use `en-US-Wavenet-D` (DEEP MALE voice)

**Result**: Narrator is now a VERY DEEP male voice with:
- Voice: en-US-Wavenet-D
- Pitch: -10.0 (automatic from backend)
- Rate: 0.82 (automatic from backend)

**This was the missing piece!** The backend was configured correctly, but the frontend was overriding it with a female voice. Now they match! 🎉
