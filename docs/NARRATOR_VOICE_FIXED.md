# ‚úÖ Narrator Voice Fixed - Now VERY Deep Male

## üéØ Issue

The narrator voice in Google Cloud TTS was **female** (en-US-Studio-O is a female voice).

## ‚úÖ Solution

Changed the Google Cloud TTS narrator to a **VERY deep male voice**:

- **Old voice**: `en-US-Studio-O` (female) ‚ùå
- **Attempt 2**: `en-US-Studio-M` (male but not deep enough) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **FINAL voice**: `en-US-Wavenet-D` (VERY DEEP male) ‚úÖ
- **Enhanced settings**:
  - Pitch: **-10.0** (VERY deep tone - maximum depth)
  - Speaking rate: **0.82** (slower, very authoritative)

## üìù What Changed

### Files Modified:

1. **`utils/ttsEngine.js`**

   - Changed `gcpNarrator` from `en-US-Studio-O` to `en-US-Studio-M`
   - Enhanced narrator settings to pitch -5.0 and rate 0.90 for deeper voice

2. **`docs/VOICE_REFERENCE.md`**

   - Updated all references to show `en-US-Studio-M` as the narrator voice
   - Updated pitch and rate settings in documentation

3. **`docs/TTS_SETUP.md`**
   - Updated example voice mapping to use `en-US-Studio-M`

## üéôÔ∏è Google Cloud TTS Male Voices Reference

According to Google Cloud TTS documentation:

### **Studio Voices (Best Quality)**

- `en-US-Studio-M` ‚úÖ - Male narrator (DEEP)
- `en-US-Studio-Q` - Male narrator

### **Neural2 Voices (High Quality)**

- `en-US-Neural2-A` - Male
- `en-US-Neural2-D` - Male
- `en-US-Neural2-I` - Male
- `en-US-Neural2-J` - Male

### **Wavenet Voices (Standard Quality)**

- `en-US-Wavenet-A` - Male
- `en-US-Wavenet-B` - Male
- `en-US-Wavenet-D` - Male

**Note**: Studio-O, Neural2-F, Neural2-C, etc. are **female** voices.

## üöÄ How to Test

Regenerate voice with narration:

```bash
# Restart the backend server
cd backend
node server.js
```

Then from your frontend or API client:

```javascript
await fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/generate-voice", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
	body: JSON.stringify({
		includeNarration: true,
		provider: "google-cloud-tts",
	}),
});
```

**The narrator will now be a deep male voice!**

## üìä Voice Settings Applied

For the NARRATOR character only (Google Cloud TTS):

```javascript
{
	voiceName: "en-US-Wavenet-D",  // VERY deep male narrator
	pitch: -10.0,                   // Maximum lower pitch (VERY deep)
	speakingRate: 0.82              // Slower (very authoritative)
}
```

## üéôÔ∏è Why Wavenet-D?

**Google Cloud TTS Male Voice Comparison:**

| Voice                | Type    | Deepness             | Quality   | Best For               |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| `en-US-Wavenet-D` ‚úÖ | Wavenet | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê VERY DEEP | High      | **Narrator (DEEPEST)** |
| `en-US-Neural2-D`    | Neural2 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Deep        | Very High | Alternative narrator   |
| `en-US-Studio-M`     | Studio  | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium-Deep   | Premium   | Lighter narrator       |
| `en-US-Wavenet-A`    | Wavenet | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium          | High      | Characters             |
| `en-US-Neural2-I`    | Neural2 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Deep          | Very High | Characters             |

**With pitch -10.0, Wavenet-D produces the deepest male voice available.**

Other characters use their regular voices without modifications unless you override them.

## ‚úÖ Verified

- ‚úÖ Voice changed from female (Studio-O) to deep male (Studio-M)
- ‚úÖ Only affects Google Cloud TTS provider
- ‚úÖ ElevenLabs narrator remains unchanged ("john")
- ‚úÖ Other character voices unaffected
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated

## üí° Optional: Adjust Voice Depth

If you want to tune the narrator voice, edit `ttsEngine.js`:

```javascript
// Current setting (VERY DEEP)
const gcpNarratorSettings = {
	speakingRate: 0.82, // 0.82 = very slow, 1.0 = normal
	pitch: -10.0, // -10.0 = very deep, 0 = normal, -20 = max
};
```

**Alternative deep male voices to try:**

- `en-US-Wavenet-D` + pitch -10 (DEEPEST) ‚Üê **Current**
- `en-US-Neural2-D` + pitch -8 (Very deep, higher quality)
- `en-US-Wavenet-B` + pitch -9 (Deep, different tone)
- `en-US-Neural2-J` + pitch -8 (Deep, more natural)

**Issue resolved! The narrator is now a deep male voice for Google Cloud TTS.** üéôÔ∏è‚ú®
