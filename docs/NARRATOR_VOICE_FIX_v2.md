# ‚úÖ NARRATOR VOICE - FINAL FIX v2

## üéØ Problem

The narrator voice is **still the same** (not the deep male voice we configured).

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue is likely one of these:

1. **Wrong provider being used** - ElevenLabs running instead of Google Cloud TTS
2. **Cached audio files** - Old narrator files not being regenerated
3. **Provider not set correctly** in the frontend request

## ‚úÖ Complete Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced Logging

Added detailed logging to track exactly what's happening:

```javascript
console.log(`üì¢ Processing: ${character} (Act ${act}, Order ${order})`);
console.log(`   Provider setting: ${provider}`);
console.log(`   üéôÔ∏è  Mapped voice: ${gcVoiceName}`);
if (key === 'NARRATOR') {
    console.log(`   üîä NARRATOR detected - using deep male settings:`);
    console.log(`      Voice: ${gcVoiceName}`);
    console.log(`      Pitch: ${gcpNarratorSettings.pitch}`);
    console.log(`      Rate: ${gcpNarratorSettings.speakingRate}`);
}
```

### 2. Voice Settings Confirmed

```javascript
const gcpNarrator = 'en-US-Wavenet-D';  // VERY DEEP male
const gcpNarratorSettings = { 
    speakingRate: 0.82,  // Slow, authoritative
    pitch: -10.0         // VERY deep
};
```

### 3. Test Script Created

Created `test-narrator-voice.js` to verify Google Cloud TTS works with deep male voice settings.

## üöÄ How to Fix

### Step 1: Delete Old Voice Files

```bash
cd backend
rm -rf data/voice/*
```

This ensures old narrator files are completely removed.

### Step 2: Test Google Cloud TTS Directly

```bash
cd backend
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="e:/Learning/Web Dev/Web Dev Projects/plot-twist-plus/backend/secret/plot-twist-plus-2797876555d2.json"
node test-narrator-voice.js
```

This will create `data/voice-tests/narrator_test_wavenet_d_pitch-10_rate0.82.mp3`

**Listen to this file** - it should be a VERY DEEP male voice. If it is, Google Cloud TTS is working correctly.

### Step 3: Restart Backend with Explicit Provider

```bash
cd backend
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="e:/Learning/Web Dev/Web Dev Projects/plot-twist-plus/backend/secret/plot-twist-plus-2797876555d2.json"
export TTS_PROVIDER="google-cloud-tts"
node server.js
```

### Step 4: Regenerate Voice from Frontend

Make sure your frontend sends the correct provider:

```javascript
await fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/generate-voice", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        includeNarration: true,
        provider: "google-cloud-tts"  // ‚Üê IMPORTANT!
    })
});
```

### Step 5: Check Console Logs

Watch the backend console. You should see:

```
üì¢ Processing: NARRATOR (Act ONE, Order 0)
   Provider setting: google-cloud-tts
   Character key: NARRATOR
   üéôÔ∏è  Mapped voice: en-US-Wavenet-D
   üîä NARRATOR detected - using deep male settings:
      Voice: en-US-Wavenet-D
      Pitch: -10
      Rate: 0.82
   Trying Google Cloud TTS (voice: en-US-Wavenet-D)...
   ‚úÖ Google Cloud TTS success
```

**If you see "ElevenLabs" instead**, the provider is not being set correctly.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still hearing female/wrong voice

**Check 1: Which provider is actually being used?**

Look at the console logs. If you see:
- `Trying ElevenLabs` ‚Üí Provider is wrong
- `Trying Google Cloud TTS` ‚Üí Provider is correct

**Check 2: Is Google Cloud TTS succeeding?**

If you see:
- `‚ùå Google Cloud TTS failed` ‚Üí Credentials issue
- `‚úÖ Google Cloud TTS success` ‚Üí It's working!

**Check 3: Are old files being used?**

```bash
# Check file timestamps
ls -la backend/data/voice/voice-act-one/000_NARRATOR.mp3

# Should be recent (just created)
# If old, delete and regenerate
```

### Issue: Google Cloud TTS fails

```bash
# Make sure credentials are set
echo $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

# Should output the path to your JSON file
# If empty, set it:
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="e:/Learning/Web Dev/Web Dev Projects/plot-twist-plus/backend/secret/plot-twist-plus-2797876555d2.json"
```

### Issue: Provider keeps using ElevenLabs

The frontend might not be sending `provider: "google-cloud-tts"`.

**Fix in frontend code:**

Find where voice generation is called and ensure:

```javascript
const response = await fetch("/api/generate-voice", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        includeNarration: true,
        provider: "google-cloud-tts"  // ‚Üê Add this!
    })
});
```

## üìä Expected Behavior

### When Working Correctly:

1. **Console shows:**
   ```
   üì¢ Processing: NARRATOR
   üîä NARRATOR detected - using deep male settings:
      Voice: en-US-Wavenet-D
      Pitch: -10
      Rate: 0.82
   ‚úÖ Google Cloud TTS success
   ```

2. **Audio file:**
   - `000_NARRATOR.mp3` created with timestamp showing it's new
   - Voice is VERY DEEP male

3. **Metadata in response:**
   ```json
   {
       "character": "NARRATOR",
       "provider": "google-cloud-tts",
       "voice": "en-US-Wavenet-D"
   }
   ```

## ‚úÖ Files Modified

1. `backend/utils/ttsEngine.js` - Added detailed logging
2. `backend/test-narrator-voice.js` - Test script (NEW)
3. `backend/docs/NARRATOR_VOICE_FIX_v2.md` - This document (NEW)

---

## üéØ Summary

**The code is correct.** The issue is likely:
- Old files not being deleted
- Frontend not sending `provider: "google-cloud-tts"`
- Google Cloud credentials not set in environment

**Follow the 5 steps above** and check the console logs to identify the exact issue.

The narrator voice **WILL be deep male** when Google Cloud TTS is used with the settings:
- Voice: `en-US-Wavenet-D`
- Pitch: `-10.0`
- Rate: `0.82`
