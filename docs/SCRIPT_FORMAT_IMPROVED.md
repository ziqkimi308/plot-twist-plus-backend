# ‚úÖ **Script Format Improved for TTS!**

## üéØ **What Changed**

Your `buildScriptPrompt()` has been **optimized for audiobook/TTS production**!

---

## ‚ùå **OLD FORMAT (Traditional Screenplay)**

**Problems:**
- Action lines mixed between dialogue
- Hard to separate narrator from characters
- Complex extraction logic
- Sometimes ambiguous who's speaking

**Example Output:**
```
FADE IN:

INT. DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A dimly lit office. Detective SARAH CHEN sits at her desk.

SARAH CHEN
Something doesn't add up.

The door bursts open. Marcus enters.

MARCUS REED
I found something!
```

**TTS Extraction Issues:**
- "A dimly lit office..." - Who speaks this?
- "The door bursts open..." - Mixed with dialogue
- Extraction logic must guess context
- Narrator voice not explicit

---

## ‚úÖ **NEW FORMAT (TTS-Optimized)**

**Benefits:**
- Explicit NARRATOR blocks
- Clean separation
- Easy extraction
- Perfect for voice actors

**Example Output:**
```
NARRATOR
Interior. A detective's office at night. A dimly lit room. Detective Sarah Chen sits at her desk, examining case files.

SARAH CHEN
Something doesn't add up here. The timeline is all wrong.

NARRATOR
The door suddenly bursts open. Detective Marcus Reed rushes in, out of breath.

MARCUS REED
I found something! You need to see this right now.

NARRATOR
Sarah looks up, startled. Marcus places a folder on her desk.
```

**TTS Extraction:**
- ‚úÖ NARRATOR = Deep voice (arnold)
- ‚úÖ SARAH CHEN = Female voice (rachel)
- ‚úÖ MARCUS REED = Male voice (josh)
- ‚úÖ No confusion, perfect extraction

## üìã **New Script Guidelines**

### **What the AI Now Generates:**

1. **NARRATOR Blocks** (Action/Description)
   - Scene settings
   - Character actions
   - Emotions and expressions
   - Environmental details
   - Transitions

2. **CHARACTER Blocks** (Dialogue Only)
   - Pure character speech
   - No action descriptions
   - Natural conversation

3. **Alternating Pattern**
   ```
   NARRATOR ‚Üí CHARACTER ‚Üí NARRATOR ‚Üí CHARACTER ‚Üí NARRATOR
   ```

---

## üé≠ **Example: Complete Scene**

```
NARRATOR
Interior. An abandoned warehouse at night. Rain hammers against the broken windows. Detective Sarah Chen moves cautiously through the darkness, flashlight in hand.

SARAH CHEN
Police! Show yourself!

NARRATOR
A figure emerges from the shadows. It's Marcus Reed, her former partner thought to be dead.

MARCUS REED
Hello, Sarah. It's been a while.

NARRATOR
Sarah's hand instinctively moves to her weapon. Her face shows shock and betrayal.

SARAH CHEN
Marcus? They said you were dead.

MARCUS REED
They were wrong.

NARRATOR
Marcus steps into the light. A scar runs down his left cheek, a reminder of his past.

SARAH CHEN
What happened to you?

MARCUS REED
The same people who are after you now.

NARRATOR
Thunder crashes outside. Sarah lowers her weapon slightly, her mind racing.
```

## üéôÔ∏è **Voice Assignment Example**

```javascript
const voiceMapping = {
    'NARRATOR': 'arnold',        // Deep, authoritative
    'SARAH CHEN': 'rachel',      // Calm female
    'MARCUS REED': 'sam'         // Raspy, mysterious
};

const results = await generateScriptVoices(script, {
    includeNarration: true,
    voiceMapping: voiceMapping
});
```

**Output:**
```
000_NARRATOR.mp3    - "Interior. An abandoned warehouse at night..."
001_SARAH_CHEN.mp3  - "Police! Show yourself!"
002_NARRATOR.mp3    - "A figure emerges from the shadows..."
003_MARCUS_REED.mp3 - "Hello, Sarah. It's been a while."
004_NARRATOR.mp3    - "Sarah's hand instinctively moves..."
...
```

## üöÄ **How to Use**

### **Your Existing Code Still Works!**

```javascript
// Generate plot
const plot = await generatePlot(genre, characters, setting);

// Generate script (NOW OPTIMIZED FOR TTS!)
const scriptPrompt = buildScriptPrompt(plot);
const script = await generateWithGroq(scriptPrompt);

// Generate voices (EASIER NOW!)
const audioFiles = await generateScriptVoices(script, {
    includeNarration: true,      // Automatically extracts NARRATOR blocks
    narratorVoice: 'arnold',     // Deep voice for narration
    voiceMapping: {
        'NARRATOR': 'arnold',
        'CHARACTER1': 'rachel',
        'CHARACTER2': 'josh'
    }
});
```

---

## ‚úÖ **What This Fixes**

### **Before (Problematic):**
```
SARAH
Something's wrong.

The phone rings. She picks it up.

SARAH
Hello?
```
**Problem:** "The phone rings..." - Who speaks this?

### **After (Clear):**
```
SARAH CHEN
Something's wrong.

NARRATOR
The phone suddenly rings. She hesitates, then picks it up.

SARAH CHEN
Hello?
```
**Solution:** NARRATOR explicitly handles action!
