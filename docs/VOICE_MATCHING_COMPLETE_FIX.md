# Voice Matching Issues - Complete Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

Voices were not matching characters correctly. Analysis revealed multiple issues:

### Issues Found:

1. **Character Name Mismatches**

   - Script used "MARILY" but plot defined "Marry Thompson"
   - Script used "LIAM CHEN" but plot defined "Dr. Liam Chen"
   - Script used "RACHEL LEE" but plot defined "Dr. Rachel Lee"
   - Name extraction didn't handle titles (Dr., Mr., Mrs., etc.)

2. **Incorrect Voice Assignment Order**

   - Voices were assigned alphabetically instead of by character importance
   - CROWLEY (supporting) got main male voice (British)
   - EMILY PATEL (supporting) got main female voice (American)
   - JOHN (actual protagonist) got supporting voice (Indian accent)

3. **Character Gender Detection Issues**
   - Some characters weren't properly matched between plot and script
   - First name extraction for characters with titles wasn't working

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Character Name Extraction (`extractCharactersFromPlot`)

**Location**: `backend/utils/ttsEngine.js` (lines 70-140)

**Changes**:

- Returns both `genderMap` and `characterOrder` array
- Stores multiple name variations:
  - Full name: "DR. RACHEL LEE"
  - Name without title: "RACHEL LEE"
  - First name only: "RACHEL"
- Tracks character order from plot's CHARACTERS section
- Handles common titles: Dr., Mr., Mrs., Ms., Detective, Professor, etc.

**Before**:

```javascript
return genderMap; // Just the map
```

**After**:

```javascript
return { genderMap, characterOrder }; // Map + order array
```

### 2. Fixed Voice Assignment Logic

**Location**: `backend/utils/ttsEngine.js` (lines 700-800)

**Changes**:

- Uses `characterOrder` from plot to identify main characters
- First male character in plot = main male voice
- First female character in plot = main female voice
- Matches characters flexibly (handles titles and first names)

**Before** (alphabetical):

```
CROWLEY -> Main Male (British)  ❌
EMILY PATEL -> Main Female (American)  ❌
JOHN -> Supporting Male (Indian)  ❌
```

**After** (plot order):

```
JOHN -> Main Male (British)  ✅
MARRY -> Main Female (American)  ✅
CROWLEY -> Supporting Male (Indian)  ✅
```

### 3. Fixed Script Typo

**Location**: `backend/data/script/script-complete.txt`

**Change**: `MARILY` → `MARRY`

### 4. Added Main Voice Settings to Function Parameters

**Location**: `backend/utils/ttsEngine.js` (lines 840-870)

**Added parameters** to `generateSingleVoice`:

- `gcpMainMale` - British deep voice for main male
- `gcpMainFemale` - American strong voice for main female
- `gcpMainMaleSettings` - Pitch/rate for main male
- `gcpMainFemaleSettings` - Pitch/rate for main female

## Final Voice Assignments

Based on character order from plot:

| Character             | Role        | Voice           | Accent     | Pitch | Rate |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- | ---- |
| **NARRATOR**          | Narrator    | en-US-Wavenet-D | American   | -10.0 | 0.82 |
| **JOHN TAYLOR** 👑    | Main Male   | en-GB-Wavenet-D | British    | -6.0  | 0.92 |
| **MARRY THOMPSON** 👑 | Main Female | en-US-Neural2-H | American   | -2.0  | 0.95 |
| CROWLEY JENKINS       | Supporting  | en-IN-Neural2-B | Indian     | -5.0  | 0.95 |
| DR. RACHEL LEE        | Supporting  | en-AU-Neural2-A | Australian | -3.0  | 0.98 |
| DR. LIAM CHEN         | Supporting  | en-AU-Neural2-D | Australian | -5.0  | 0.95 |
| EMILY PATEL           | Supporting  | en-GB-Neural2-A | British    | -3.0  | 0.98 |

## How It Works Now

### Character Matching Process

1. **Plot Parsing**: Extract characters from plot's CHARACTERS section in order
2. **Name Variations**: Store full name, first name, and name without title
3. **Main Character Detection**: First male + first female from plot order
4. **Flexible Matching**: Match script characters to plot using any variation

### Example Flow

```
Plot: "- John Taylor (male)" <- FIRST MALE
      "- Marry Thompson (female)" <- FIRST FEMALE
      "- Crowley Jenkins (male)"

Extracted:
  - JOHN TAYLOR → male (order: 1, main male)
  - JOHN → male
  - MARRY THOMPSON → female (order: 2, main female)
  - MARRY → female
  - CROWLEY JENKINS → male (order: 3, supporting)
  - CROWLEY → male

Script Character "JOHN":
  Match found: JOHN → male (plot order 1)
  Is main character: YES (first male)
  Assigned voice: en-GB-Wavenet-D (British main)
```

## Testing

### Diagnostic Test

```bash
node test-voice-assignments.js
```

Shows expected voice assignments based on plot order.

### Generation Test

```bash
node test-voice-generation-fixed.js
```

Generates actual audio files with correct voice assignments.

### Expected Results

```
👑 Main male character from plot: JOHN TAYLOR
👑 Main female character from plot: MARRY THOMPSON

Voice Assignments:
  JOHN -> en-GB-Wavenet-D (British main male)
  MARRY -> en-US-Neural2-H (American main female)
  CROWLEY -> en-IN-Neural2-B (Indian supporting male)
  ...
```

## Files Modified

1. **backend/utils/ttsEngine.js**

   - Enhanced `extractCharactersFromPlot()` function
   - Updated voice assignment logic
   - Added main character detection from plot order
   - Fixed function parameter passing

2. **backend/data/script/script-complete.txt**

   - Fixed typo: MARILY → MARRY

3. **Documentation**
   - Created `VOICE_MATCHING_FIX.md`
   - Created diagnostic tests

## Frontend Integration

No frontend changes required. The frontend already:

- Receives correct `audioFiles` array from backend
- Plays files in correct order based on `order` field
- Matches audio to script lines correctly

The fix is entirely backend-focused, ensuring the right voices are generated for each character before the frontend receives them.

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Check voice assignments**:

   ```bash
   node test-voice-assignments.js
   ```

   Look for: "👑 MAIN Male (British) [from plot]" for JOHN

2. **Generate and listen**:

   - Start backend: `npm start`
   - Use frontend to generate a new story
   - Listen to Act One - John should have British accent
   - Marry should have American female voice
   - Supporting characters should have diverse international accents

3. **Check audio files**:
   ```bash
   ls backend/data/voice/voice-act-one/
   ```
   Files should be named correctly: `001_JOHN.mp3`, `003_CROWLEY.mp3`, etc.

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**: Character name extraction handles titles and variations
✅ **Fixed**: Voice assignment respects plot character order  
✅ **Fixed**: Main characters get main voices, supporting get supporting voices
✅ **Fixed**: Script typo (MARILY → MARRY)
✅ **Tested**: Diagnostic tests confirm correct assignments
✅ **Verified**: Voice generation produces correct character-voice pairings

The voice matching system now correctly assigns voices based on character importance from the plot, with flexible name matching to handle variations like titles and first/last names.
