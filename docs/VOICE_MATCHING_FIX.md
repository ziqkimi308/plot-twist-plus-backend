# Voice Matching Fix - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Character Name Extraction (`extractCharactersFromPlot`)

**Problem**: The function wasn't properly handling:

- Titles (Dr., Mr., Mrs., Ms.)
- Multiple name variations (full name vs first name vs name without title)
- Character order for main character detection

**Solution**: Updated function to:

- Extract and store multiple name variations:
  - Full name: "DR. RACHEL LEE"
  - Name without title: "RACHEL LEE"
  - First name: "RACHEL"
- Track character order from plot's CHARACTERS section
- Return both `genderMap` and `characterOrder` array

### 2. Voice Assignment Logic

**Problem**: Voices were assigned alphabetically, causing:

- CROWLEY (supporting) got main male voice
- EMILY PATEL (supporting) got main female voice
- JOHN (actual main) got supporting voice

**Solution**: Updated voice assignment to:

- Use character order from plot (first male & first female = main characters)
- Match characters by checking:
  - Exact match (JOHN TAYLOR)
  - First name match (JOHN)
  - Name without title (RACHEL LEE from DR. RACHEL LEE)

### 3. Script Typo

**Problem**: Script had "MARILY" instead of "MARRY"

**Solution**: Fixed typo in script-complete.txt

## Voice Assignments (After Fix)

Based on plot order:

- **JOHN TAYLOR** (first male) → `en-GB-Wavenet-D` (British main male, deep & fierce)
- **MARRY THOMPSON** (first female) → `en-US-Neural2-H` (American main female, clear & strong)
- CROWLEY JENKINS → `en-IN-Neural2-B` (Indian accent, supporting male)
- DR. RACHEL LEE → `en-AU-Neural2-A` (Australian accent, supporting female)
- DR. LIAM CHEN → `en-AU-Neural2-D` (Australian accent, supporting male)
- EMILY PATEL → `en-GB-Neural2-A` (British accent, supporting female)
- NARRATOR → `en-US-Wavenet-D` (VERY DEEP male narrator)

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:

1. `backend/utils/ttsEngine.js`

   - Updated `extractCharactersFromPlot()` to return `{ genderMap, characterOrder }`
   - Modified voice assignment logic to use `characterOrder` for main character detection
   - Added name variation matching (with/without titles, first name only)

2. `backend/data/script/script-complete.txt`
   - Fixed typo: MARILY → MARRY

### Character Name Matching

The system now handles these variations:

```
Plot: "Dr. Rachel Lee (female)"
Script can use: "RACHEL LEE" ✅ or "RACHEL" ✅ or "DR. RACHEL LEE" ✅

Plot: "John Taylor (male)"
Script can use: "JOHN" ✅ or "JOHN TAYLOR" ✅
```

## Testing

Run diagnostic test:

```bash
node test-voice-assignments.js
```

Expected output:

- JOHN gets main male voice (en-GB-Wavenet-D)
- MARRY gets main female voice (en-US-Neural2-H)
- Other characters get supporting voices in diverse accents

## Next Steps

To regenerate voices with correct assignments:

1. Clear old voice files: `rm -rf backend/data/voice/*`
2. Regenerate: Call `/api/generate-voice` endpoint
3. Verify audio files have correct voices for each character

## Frontend Impact

No frontend changes needed. The voice files are served from:
`/api/generate-voice/audio/{actFolder}/{filename}`

Frontend already correctly plays files in order based on the `audioFiles` array returned from the backend.
