# ❌ Google Cloud TTS - Reverted (Requires Billing Account)

## 🔍 **Discovery:**

Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API **requires a billing account** (credit card) even for the free tier.

> "Cloud Text-to-Speech API requires a project with a billing account."

---

## ❌ **Why It Was Reverted:**

### **The Problem:**
- ✅ Google Cloud TTS has FREE tier (4M chars/month)
- ✅ Supports 220+ voices
- ✅ Has pitch/speed control
- ❌ **BUT requires credit card to activate**

### **Project Goal:**
- ✅ 100% FREE without credit card
- ✅ No payment information required
- ✅ Accessible to everyone

**Conclusion:** Google Cloud TTS doesn't meet the "no credit card" requirement.

---

## ✅ **Current System (Best for Free Projects):**

### **2-Tier Fallback:**

```
1️⃣  ElevenLabs (Primary)
    • 10,000 chars/month FREE
