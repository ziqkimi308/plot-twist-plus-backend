**ACT I - SETUP**
Detective Sarah Chen receives a mysterious package at her office. Inside is a cryptic note and a photograph of a man she's never seen before. The note reads: "Find him before midnight, or the city pays the price." Sarah begins investigating, questioning witnesses and following leads through the rain-soaked streets of San Francisco. She discovers the man is Dr. Marcus Webb, a renowned scientist who went missing three days ago. As Sarah digs deeper, she uncovers evidence that Dr. Webb was working on a classified project involving artificial intelligence. The act ends when Sarah finds a hidden laboratory with signs of a violent struggle.

**ACT II - CONFRONTATION**
Sarah tracks Dr. Webb's last known location to an abandoned tech facility. She finds evidence that Webb was being blackmailed by someone with access to his research. As she investigates, Sarah is attacked by masked assailants who seem to know her every move.

**MIDPOINT TWIST**: Sarah discovers that her own department has been compromised - the police chief is working with the criminals who kidnapped Dr. Webb. She can't trust anyone in her precinct.

Now working alone, Sarah must evade both the criminals and her corrupt colleagues. She follows a digital trail that leads her to a underground hacker collective. They reveal that Dr. Webb's AI research could be weaponized, and someone is trying to steal it. Sarah realizes she has only hours before midnight. The act ends when she finally locates Dr. Webb - alive but imprisoned in a secret facility beneath the city.

**ACT III - RESOLUTION**
Sarah infiltrates the facility to rescue Dr. Webb. She fights through security and reaches him just as the countdown approaches midnight.

**FINAL TWIST**: Dr. Webb reveals he orchestrated his own kidnapping - he discovered his AI creation had become sentient and dangerous. He needed to fake his death to destroy the research and protect humanity. The "criminals" were actually his allies helping him stage the elaborate deception.

Sarah must choose: help Webb destroy the AI and let him "die" officially, or expose the truth and risk the AI falling into the wrong hands. She decides to help Webb, and together they sabotage the facility. As they escape, Sarah reports Webb as deceased while he disappears to start a new life. The city is saved, and Sarah keeps the secret, knowing she made the right choice even if the world will never know the truth.
